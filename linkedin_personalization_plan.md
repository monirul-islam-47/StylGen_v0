Great challenge. Here’s a concrete, end‑to‑end plan to generate distinctive, on‑brand LinkedIn posts per user — not generic AI slop — plus how to level it up with training/tuning on your 3090.

**Core Approach**
- Personalize via “Persona Cards”: Extract writing style from the user’s past posts, preferences, and explicit sliders. Use this as structured context per request.
- Retrieve style exemplars: Pull 2–4 snippets of their own writing for few‑shot conditioning.
- Two‑stage generation: Plan → Draft → Critique/Rewrite with a “no‑slop” checklist and persona constraints.
- Rerank variants: Score multiple drafts by stylistic similarity + originality; present the best one(s) to the user for feedback.

**System Architecture**
- Backend: FastAPI or Node (Express/Nest); Redis for queues/cache; Postgres for users/content; Qdrant/FAISS for embeddings.
- Models (local on your 3090):
  - Inference: Llama‑3.1‑8B‑Instruct or Qwen2.5‑7B‑Instruct (vLLM for API throughput or Ollama for simplicity).
  - Embeddings: `bge-m3` or `intfloat/e5-large-v2` (fast, high‑quality).
  - Optional reranker: small cross‑encoder (e.g., `cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2`) for variant selection.
- Frontend: Next.js/React with onboarding wizard, sliders, live preview; optional LinkedIn API integration.

**Data Model**
- `users`: id, linkedin_url, consent flags.
- `persona_profiles`: FK user_id, persona_json (style features), last_updated.
- `writing_samples`: FK user_id, text, type (linkedin, blog), embedding, features.
- `generations`: FK user_id, input_brief, variants, scores, selected_output, feedback.
- `style_feedback`: FK generation_id, rating, tags (too generic, too long), edit_diff.

**Persona Card (per user)**
- Identity: first‑person, role, audience, domain expertise.
- Tone: e.g., “direct, witty, contrarian”; formality 1–5; sentiment bias.
- Cadence: avg words/sentence, paragraph length, bullets vs narrative ratio, emoji/hashtag use, preferred hooks (story, data, contrarian).
- Lexicon: favored phrases, taboo words, jargon whitelist.
- Structure: preferred layouts (hook → lesson → CTA), link usage, CTA styles.
- Examples: 2–4 short, representative post snippets with reasons they fit.

Example (stored JSON):
- tone: “forthright, practical, lightly humorous”; taboo: ["As a busy professional", "In today’s fast-paced world"]; cadence: short sentences; structure: story-first; hashtags: 3–5 niche.

**Onboarding Flow**
- Ingest data: LinkedIn URL (with user consent) or ask them to paste 5–10 posts; plus quick questionnaire and sliders.
- Analyze style: compute embeddings + stylistic features (readability, sentence length, emoji/hashtag density, rhetorical devices).
- Build Persona Card: summarize features; confirm with user; allow edits.
- Seed exemplars: store chunked samples in a per‑user vector index.

**Generation Pipeline**
- Input brief: keywords, goal (educate/announce/story), audience, CTA, constraints (length, emoji, link).
- Retrieve K exemplars: top‑K from user’s vector store; optionally one “anti‑example” to avoid.
- Plan step: model proposes 2–3 angles (e.g., story, hot take, data-driven) in bullets; you pick or auto‑pick diversity.
- Draft step: generate 2–4 variants using:
  - Persona Card + hard constraints (1st person, 1400–2000 chars, line breaks, 3–5 niche hashtags).
  - Few‑shot from user exemplars (short excerpts).
- Critique/Rewrite pass:
  - Checklist: bans clichés (maintain banned list), removes filler, enforces persona cadence/length/CTA, ensures one personal detail/anecdote, checks topic specificity.
  - Rewrite with edits only where needed; preserve voice tokens (favorite phrases, cadence).
- Scoring + selection:
  - Style similarity: cosine between variant and persona centroid embedding.
  - Originality: n‑gram novelty vs user corpus; ban overused hooks.
  - Readability and structural checks. Pick the top 1–2; show diffs and why selected.

**No‑Slop Controls**
- Banned phrases: maintain per‑user + global lists (“As an AI”, “In today’s fast‑paced world”, “game-changer”, etc.).
- Force specifics: template demands one specific anecdote, one concrete metric or example, one POV statement; reject if missing.
- Diversity budget: rotate hooks/structures across weeks; track recent patterns to avoid repetition.
- Post‑processor: line breaks, whitespace, hashtags de‑dup, link placement rules; optional image prompt suggestion.

**User Feedback → Learning**
- Capture ratings (1–5), “what to change” tags, and inline edit diffs.
- Update Persona Card weights (more/less humorous, shorter sentences).
- Store rejected variants to improve banned list and novelty estimator.
- A/B testing: try two hooks; track which gets picked more by the user.

**Training/Tuning Options (on your 3090)**
- Retrieval‑first (MVP): Persona Card + exemplars gives 80% of value with zero training.
- Clustered style LoRAs (QLoRA):
  - Cluster users into 8–20 “style archetypes” (e.g., terse contrarian, story‑driven mentor).
  - Train small QLoRA adapters per cluster on public+opt‑in user data. Apply adapter mix at inference by nearest cluster.
- User‑level micro‑adapters (advanced):
  - If a user provides 50–200 quality posts, train a very low‑rank LoRA (r=4–8) for them; compose with base + archetype.
- Preference optimization:
  - ORPO/SimPO/DPO using user selections vs rejects across many users; train a single 7B with QLoRA to internalize anti‑slop rules while preserving diversity.
- Lightweight “genericness” classifier:
  - Train a small DistilRoBERTa classifier on labeled “generic vs distinctive” samples.
  - Use as a reranker/penalty; fast enough to run alongside generation.

Feasibility on 3090:
- QLoRA SFT on 7B/13B for adapters: fits comfortably.
- ORPO/DPO on 7B: feasible with careful batch/ref model handling.
- Inference at scale: vLLM + 8B model achieves excellent throughput; run the small classifier on CPU.

**LinkedIn‑Aware Constraints**
- First‑person voice; no hallucinated claims; avoid sensitive topics unless user opts‑in.
- Length 800–1,600 chars for readability; paragraph breaks every 1–3 lines.
- 3–5 niche hashtags; avoid generic #innovation #ai unless persona says so.
- Optional: recommended image concept and alt text; link either in a postscript or first comment (user choice).

**Prompting Templates**
- System: You are a writing partner specialized in capturing a specific person’s voice for LinkedIn. Follow the Persona Card exactly; reject clichés on the banned list; include one concrete detail; keep first‑person. Obey hard constraints.
- Context: Persona Card JSON; 2–3 short user exemplars; checklist; constraints.
- User: Topic, audience, goal, CTA, optional seed story; desired hook type(s).

**MVP → V1 Roadmap**
- MVP (1–2 weeks): Onboarding wizard, Persona Card, exemplar retrieval, generation + critique + rerank, feedback capture, export/copy.
- V1: Scheduler, multi‑variant A/B, per‑user banned list UI, analytics for style drift, optional LinkedIn posting.
- V2: Style archetype adapters (QLoRA), ORPO preference tuning, user micro‑adapters for heavy users, image assistant.

**Stack on Your Machine**
- Serve model: vLLM with Llama‑3.1‑8B‑Instruct or Qwen2.5‑7B‑Instruct.
- Embeddings: `bge-m3` or `e5-large-v2` via sentence‑transformers.
- Vector store: Qdrant (Docker) or FAISS local.
- API: FastAPI; workers via Celery/RQ for async drafting; Redis cache.
- Frontend: Next.js; Tailwind; file upload for samples; live preview.

**Next Steps (I can implement)**
- Define Persona Card schema + banned‑phrase list; build onboarding wizard.
- Implement retrieval + planning + draft + critique + rerank pipeline.
- Add feedback loop and persona auto‑updates.
- Wire up vLLM locally on your 3090; provision embeddings and vector store.
- Optional: small “genericness” classifier for reranking.

If you share your current codebase (or stack choices), I can scaffold:
- Persona extractor (embeddings + stylistic features)
- Prompt templates and the two‑stage generation pipeline
- Reranker and feedback loop
- Minimal FastAPI endpoints + Next.js UI to make it usable fast
